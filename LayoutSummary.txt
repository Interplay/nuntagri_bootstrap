The problem isn't a lack of food

Hunger is a logistics problem

It is a problem of getting the available food to the people who need it most

"In Kenya, a country where agriculture is the backbone of a very diverse and bustling economy, people still go hungry and food  rots in the  farms becasue the farmers don't have access to a proper supply chain to get their surplusses to the markets"

"The current food system wasn't designed to be sustainable, or healthy, or fair to local farmers"

"It was designed for three other goals:"

"Now we are ready for a new logistic. Logistics that makes it possible for the farmers in this region to fit inside this region's food distribution system."

"This means:

	-Food hubs working with distributors
	
	-Small companies working with each other
	
	-Growers in formal cooperatives
	
	-Growers cooperating informally"
